## ⚠️ Code Limitations & Protection

To protect the app’s proprietary content and logic, **significant parts of the implementation have been removed**, including:

- `Platforms` folder and all platform-specific files
- Application assets: images, icons, splash screens
- Portions of logic from ViewModels and Views
- Core functionality in `Structure` logic classes
- Key models and repository logic from the database layer
- Most main logic in the unit test classes

This repository is intended only as a **preview of the architecture** and **coding style** used in the app.
